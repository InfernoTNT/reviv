* Building from source

** Dependencies:

- =cmake=
- all the =glfw= dependencies (see [[https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html][here]])

** Instructions
 
#+begin_src bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/infernotnt/reviv2
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../reviv2 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build .
#+end_src

If you're using /Wayland/ on /Linux/, it should automatically get detected and =glfw= will compile for Wayland.

=Visual Studio= is probably /not/ fully supported.

After building, the executable is in =bin/Release-OS= directory. You can delete the static library files.
